# Calendar webpage
This webpage is a calendar page designed using only HTML5 and CSS3.
<p>When I say calendar, it is basically a table with dates, but in this project, I have not used the <code>table</code> tag from HTML5, and instead, all the formatting is done via CSS3. </p>
<p>The project also uses a very cool parallax effect, added with help of jQuery.</p>
